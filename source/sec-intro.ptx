        <em>Mathematics is the language with which God has written the universe.</em> -- Galileo
    </p>
    <p>Mathematics is the unique language that is precise enough to describe the 
        world for science and engineering. In this class, we will start putting together what 
        you have learned in calculus to use mathematics to describe population growth, 
        mechanical vibrations, electrical circuits, and a variety of other situations. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Differential equations are one of the most important tools in writing such 
        descriptions. A differential equation is just an equation involving one or more derivatives.
        Differential equations are important because they let you write a description of 
        a situation in terms of the forces acting in the situation. Consider Newton's second law of motion
        <me>\text{Force}=\frac{dp}{dt}</me>
        where <m>p=mv</m> is momentum and <m>t</m> is time.
        This is probably more familiar to you as <m>F=ma</m>, where we have made the
        assumption that mass is constant. Suppose you are told the acceleration of
        gravity on the moon is <m>1.6 \text{m}/\text{sec}^2</m>. If you drop a mass above the 
        surface of the moon, how far will it fall in 1 second? Here you know acceleration <m>a</m>, 
        but what you want to know is the relation between distance and time This leads to a 
        differential equation from Newton's second law above (which we will solve below). 
        In a physical situation you often know the forces acting on an object and then have 
        to determine the future behavior of the object. 
        This leads to a particularly simple differential equation (which we will analyze below). 
        Of course differential equations occur in many  other subjects besides physics. 
        The idea of thinking of a situation in terms of the "forces" acting on it makes sense 
        not just in physics but in economics, population biology, and many other disciplines. 
        We will meet a variety of applications for differential equations during this course.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the example above leads to a specific equation that we need to solve, 
        there are many situations where the key is being able to interpret the consequences 
        of a differential equation without actually finding a solution. For example, 
        Newton's third law says that for every action (force) there is an equal and 
        opposite reaction. This says the total net force in every situation is 0 
        (though there may be non-zero forces acting on any particular object in the situation). 
        Now since <m>\text{Force}=\displaystyle\frac{dp}{dt}</m>, this says 
        <me>\frac{dp}{dt}=0</me>, 
        i.e. total momentum has a 0 derivative, so <em>momentum is conserved</em>. 
        Here we have deduced a key physical law by interpreting what the differential 
        equation is saying, rather than solving a specific problem. In this class you will 
        be asked both to solve problems and also to use and interpret differential equations 
        to describe and explain mathematical and scientific ideas. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Mathematical language can be approached in several different ways. You can look at problems
        both algebraically and graphically. This class will push you to translate between these 
        different approaches so you can better understand what each tells you and be better 
        prepared to handle real problems where you may need to switch back and forth 
        between different representations. In the rest of this section, we will introduce some 
        definitions and notation, concentrating on the algebraic viewpoint. We will discuss the 
        geometric viewpoint in the next section (which we will cover in lab).
    </p>
</introduction>
<subsection>
    <title>Definitions</title>
    <p>
        A <em>differential equation</em> is an equation involving derivatives. Some examples are
        <mdn>
            <mrow>\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} \amp= -1.6 \amp </mrow>
            <mrow>(1-x^2)\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}-x\frac{dy}{dx}+\alpha^2 y\amp=0 </mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{dp}{dt}\amp=-.01p^2+p </mrow>
            <mrow>Q''+20Q'+1000Q\amp=10\cos(120\pi t) </mrow>
        </mdn>
        The first example is acceleration of gravity on the moon. The second example is Chebychev's
        equation, which defines the Chebychev polynomials which are useful in approximation theory.
        The third example is a logistic growth model from population theory. And the fourth
        example gives the charge across a capacitor in a particular LRC circuit. These are just
        a few of the many situations where differential equations occur.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that we usually write <m>x</m> or <m>p</m> instead of <m>x(t)</m>
        or <m>p(t)</m>. We will usually not distinguish between functions and 
        variables in our notation. It will actually make things easier in many problems 
        to just think of functions as variables and treat them accordingly. We will also use
        both the <m>y'</m> and <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> notation, depending on whatever is convenient.
        The key is having an equation involving derivatives, not what notation is used.
    </p>
    <p> 
        The <em>order</em> of a differential equation is the highest order of derivative that
        occurs in the equation. In the examples above, the third example is first order while the 
        other three are second order. 
    </p>
    <p>
       A <em>particular solution</em> to a differential equation is a function that 
       satisfies the equation.
       <md>
        <mrow>y(x) \amp= x^2 \amp \amp\text{is a particular solution to} \amp \frac{dy}{dx}\amp=2x </mrow>
        <mrow>y(x)\amp=x^2+1 \amp \amp\text{is a particular solution to} \amp \frac{dy}{dx}\amp=2x </mrow>
       </md>
    </p>
    <p>
        This illustrates a problem with differential equations, solutions are usually 
        not unique (a problem has a "unique" solution if it has only one solution).
        There are two common approaches to resolving this difficulty. 
        One is to ask for the general solution instead of the particular solution.
    </p> 
    <p>
       A <em>general solution</em> is a set of solutions to a differential equation with as many
       (independent) arbitrary constants as the order of the equation. For example,
       <me>y(x)=x^2+C \text{ is the general solution to } \frac{dy}{dx}=2x</me> 
       Any choice of constant <m>C</m> gives a solution, and each different choice of <m>C</m>
       gives a different solution (that is what is meant by asking for independent arbitrary
       constants). The two solutions in the previous example come from choosing $C=0$ and $C=1$.
       The equation is first order so we only expect one arbitrary constant.
       In many cases the general solution gives all the solutions but this need not
       be the case. A <em>singular solution</em> is a particular solution to an
       equation which is not an instance of the general solution. We will see
       examples of this later. (The term singular solution is sometimes given a 
       more restrictive and technical meaning in advanced courses.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Now if you are asked if a building will stay up or fall down in a heavy
        wind and you reply that there are an infinite number of possible answers, you
        shouldn't expect your boss to be happy with you. In most situations we don't
        want a general solution that lists all possible answers, but rather the 
        unique solution to our specific problem. For that we will need to narrow
        the problem. We ask not for any old solution to the problem but rather for a
        solution which also has some additional properties that define the specific
        situation. For example, we will often have
        an <em>initial value problem</em> where one wants the solution to a differential
        equation which takes a specified value at a given point. For example,
        <md>
            <mrow>\frac{dy}{dx}\amp=2x, \amp\amp  y(1)=4</mrow>
        </md>
        has a unique solution, <m>y = x^2 + 3</m>. The term initial value problem is used because
        typically the extra conditions come from knowledge of the initial state of the system. Since 
        you will have as many arbitrary constants as the order of the system, you will typically
        want as many conditions as the order to solve for that many constants. In some situations
        you will have an initial value problem with multiple conditions at the same point 
        (e.g. <m>y(0)=1</m> and <m>y'(0)=2</m>), while in others you may have 
        <em>boundary conditions</em> with values at different points (e.g. <m>y(0)=1</m> and 
        <m>y(\pi)=2</m>). We will deal mainly, though not solely, with initial value problems,
        which are both simpler theoretically and more common in practice.
    </p>
    <p>
        A function which solves a differential equation can be given in two different forms. 
        An <em>explicit solution</em> is a function written in the usual form of a formula 
        applied to an independent variable. The following functions are defined explicitly:
        <md>
            <mrow>  y(x)\amp=x^2+\tan(x) </mrow>
            <mrow> y(x)\amp=\sqrt{1-x^2} </mrow>
            <mrow>y(x)\amp=-\sqrt{1-x^2} </mrow>
        </md>
    </p>
    <p>
        A second way to write the function is to give a relationship between the 
        function and the independent variable. The implicit function theorem can 
        then be used to show a function exists which satisfies the relationship, 
        though it may be difficult or impossible to write the function 
        explicitly (the implicit function theorem is usually covered in Advanced 
        Calculus 2).
        <md>
            <mrow>y-x^2-\tan(x)\amp=0 </mrow>
            <mrow> x^2+y^2\amp=1</mrow>
        </md>
    </p>
    <p>
        The first relation above generates the first function in the previous example
        while the second relation above generates both the second and the third
        functions of the previous example. An <em>implicit solution</em> to a
        differential equation is a relation which generates a function which solves
        the equation. Note that it is possible to check if an implicit solution solves
        a differential equation without actually computing the explicit solution by
        using implicit differentiation. While an explicit solution has obvious 
        advantages over an implicit solution, often it is easier to find an implicit 
        solution while the algebra involved in generating an explicit solution cam be 
        difficult or impossible. It is also possible that an implicit solution will be 
        more familiar and easier to understand (e.g. <m>x^2+y^2=1</m> vs. 
        <m>y=\pm\sqrt{1-x^2}</m>). In these cases we will settle for an implicit solution.
    </p>

    <title>Falling on the moon</title>
    <p>
        We will close by looking at how we use a very simple differential equation to 
        answer the question asked earlier, "If you drop a mass above the 
        surface of the moon, how far will it fall in 1 second?" 
        If we let <m>x</m> be position in meters above the moon's
        surface and <m>t</m> be time in seconds, then the statement that the acceleration
        due to gravity on the moon is <m>1.6 \text{m/sec}^2</m> can be written as
        <me>\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-1.6</me>.
        Integrating this statement we get <m>\frac{dx}{dt}=-1.6t + C_1</m> and integrating a 
        second time we get the general solution,
        <me>x(t) = -0.8t^2 + C_1 t + C_2</me>.
        Since we had to integrate twice, we get two arbitrary constants, one from each
        integration. This is why the general solution to a differential equation should 
        have as many arbitrary constants as the order of the equation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now the question we wanted to answer was how far an object would fall in 1 second,
        so we want a particular solution, not the general solution. Let's look at the 
        problem again to see if we can find some additional conditions to identify a
        particular solution. The problem says we "drop" an object, which we will interpret
        to mean the object has initial velocity 0 (it has not been thrown to give it any
        initial velocity). We will set <m>t=0</m> at the moment the object is dropped, so 
        the statement that the initial velocity is 0 becomes 
        <me>x'(0) = 0</me>.
        Now since we know <m>x(t) = -0.8t^2 + C_1 t + C_2</m>, we can differentiate to find
        <md>
            <mrow>x'(t) \amp= -1.6t + C_1</mrow>
            <mrow>x'(0) \amp= C_1</mrow>
        </md>
        from which we conclude 
        <me>x(t) = -0.8t^2 + C_2</me>.
        So we've fixed the value of one of the two arbitrary constants. We don't seem to 
        have any additional information we can use to find the value of <m>C_2</m>, but that
        turns out not to be a problem. The question was how far the object would fall in 
        1 second, which becomes
        <me>x(1) - x(0) = (-0.8\times1^2 + C_2) - (-0.8\times0^2+ C_2) = -0.8</me>,
        so the <m>C_2</m> terms cancel out and the object falls 0.8 meters (with the negative
        showing the object is falling).
    </p>

<conclusion>
    <p>
        Of course, all you needed for this last problem was the basics of integral
        calculus. When you have more complicated problems where the function you
        are trying to find shows up multiple places, as in the other examples, you will
        need some new approaches. But your knowledge of Calculus will be used many times.
        Differential Equations is a wonderful capstone to the Calculus sequence.

        Mathematics is not just a set of recipes but a language that will enable 
        you to better understand how the world works.That language can be expressed 
        and understood both algebraically in formulas and 
        equations and geometrically in graphs and pictures. An ability to move between 
        these two ways of understanding will be a powerful tool. The next section will address
        how to understand differential equations geometrically.
