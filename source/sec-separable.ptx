  <title>Separable Equations</title>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>
                A first order differential equation is <em>separable</em> if the two variables 
                can be separated, that is all the <m>x</m>'s on one side of the equation and 
                all the <m>y</m>'s on the other side of the equation. We then solve the problem 
                by integrating both sides of the equation. (This is our first case where it will
                be convenient to forget that <m>y</m> is a function and treat it as a variable.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <p>
            Consider the following example.
            <me>\frac{dy}{dx}=xy^2+x</me>.
            We separate the variables by factoring the right hand side and then dividing 
            through by <m>y^2+1</m> and multiplying by <m>dx</m> to get 
            <me>\frac{dy}{y^2+1}=x\,dx</me>.
            We then integrate both sides to get an implicit solution
            <me>\arctan(y)=\displaystyle{\frac{x^2}{2}}+C</me>. 
            Finally we solve for <m>y</m> to get
            <me>y(x)=\tan(\frac{x^2}{2}+C)</me>. 
            You can check that this is a solution to the differential equation.
        </p>
        <p>
            This process should be a little disturbing. <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> is a notation
             for the derivative of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m> but the terms 
             <m>dy</m> and <m>dx</m> are just parts of the notation and have no 
             independent meaning, right? Yet we just manipulated them like any other 
             algebraic quantity. <m>dy</m> and <m>dx</m> are called
             <em>differentials</em>. We will often find it convenient to manipulate 
             differentials rather than whole derivatives; this is why the subject is 
             called differential equations rather than derivative equations. 
             Working out how to think of differentials was important in the historical 
             development of Calculus. The fact that the "obvious" manipulations can be 
             proven tp produce correct answers is a large part of the reason why 
             the <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> notation was adopted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another point is that we included the constant of integration <m>C</m> for the
            <m>x</m> integral but not for the <m>y</m> integral. We did that because if we 
            included both constants of integration, the next step would have been to subtract 
            the <m>y</m>-constant of integration from both sides of the equation and we would 
            have had the same expression, except with <m>x</m>-constant minus <m>y</m>-constant 
            instead of <m>C</m>. But the difference of two arbitrary constants is just another 
            arbitrary constant so why bother.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, there is a common algebraic error waiting to mug unwary students in 
            these equations. Consider the following example.
            <me>\frac{dy}{dx}=y^2-1</me>
            We solve this in the same manner as earlier by dividing through by <m>y^2-1</m> 
            and multiplying by <m>dx</m> to get the separated equation
            <me>\frac{dy}{y^2-1}=dx</me>.
            We then integrate both sides to get the implicit solution 
            <me>\frac12\ln\left\lvert\frac{y-1}{y+1}\right\rvert=x+C</me>. 
            We solve this for the general solution. First we multiply by 2 and 
            exponentiate both sides to get
            <me>\left\lvert\frac{y-1}{y+1}\right\rvert=e^{2C}e^{2x}</me>.
            We then remove the <m>\lvert\,\rvert</m> signs by taking <m>\pm</m> the right-hand 
            side and solve for <m>y</m> to get the explicit solution
            <me>y(x)=\frac{1+ke^{2x}}{1-ke^{2x}}</me>,
            (where <m>k=\pm e^{2C}</m>). This is the general solution; it is a 
            solution with one arbitrary constant, k, to a first order equation. But it 
            doesn't give all the solutions! You can quickly check that <m>y = -1</m> 
            is a solution, but there is no choice of <m>k</m> that gives this 
            solution. A solution not part of the general solution is called a 
            <em>singular solution</em>. So where did we lose this solution? In the first step
            when we divided by <m>y^2-1</m>. If $<m>y = -1</m>, then we divided by 0 which 
            is always trouble. A general rule of algebra, which students often miss, 
            is that whenever you divide by an expression involving a variable, 
            you must check separately to see if the <m>\text{expression}=0</m> is a solution. 
            You might also note that <m>y=1</m>, corresponding to <m>k=0</m> is also a 
            solution. Since <m>k=\pm e^C</m>, it should not be the case that <m>k=0</m>. 
            This is an example of a singular solution for the implicit solution reappearing 
            in the explicit solution. Basically we lost a
            solution via careless algebraic manipulations in finding the implicit solution 
            but we got it back by making careless algebraic manipulations (letting <m>k=0</m>)
            in finding the explicit solution. This happy accident is not uncommon and I 
            won't comment on it in the future. You should note that singular solutions are
            real solutions and are just as natural as the general solution. The 
            distinction between the singular and the general solution is just an algebraic
            distinction.

        <title>Paradigm</title>
        <introduction>We are now ready to give the paradigm for solving separable equations.
        </introduction>
        <p>Find all the solutions to 
            <me>\frac{dy}{dx}=xy+\frac yx</me>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Step 1</em> Separate the variables:
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dy}{dx}\amp=(x+1/x)y</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dy}{y}\amp=(x+1/x)\,dx</mrow>
            </md>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Step 2</em> Integrate both sides:
                <md>
                    <mrow>\int\frac{dy}{y}\amp=\int x+1/x\,dx \amp \amp</mrow>
                    <mrow>\ln|y|\amp=\frac{x^2}{2}+\ln|x|+C \amp \amp\text{(Implicit Solution)}</mrow>
                </md>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Step 3</em> Solve for the explicit solution (if possible):
                <md>
                    <mrow>|y|\amp=e^C|x|e^{x^2/2} \amp \amp </mrow>
                    <mrow>y\amp=\pm e^Cxe^{x^2/2}=kxe^{x^2/2} \amp \amp (k=\pm e^C) </mrow>
                </md>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Step 4</em> Check for singular solutions:
        </p>
        <p>
            We divided by <m>y</m> and <m>y=0</m> is clearly a solution. But it is already part of
            the general solution with <m>k=0</m>, so there are no singular solutions.
        </p>

        <introduction>
            <p>
                Now that we have the paradigm, we see how we can use it to solve some sample
                problems.
            </p>

        <subsubsection>
            <title>Multiple singular solutions</title>
            <p>
                Find all the solutions of
                <me>\frac{dy}{dx}=\cos(x)\cos(y)+\cos(y)</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Step 1:</em>
                <me>\frac{dy}{\cos(y)}=(\cos(x)+1)\,dx</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Step 2:</em> 
                <me>\ln|\sec(y)+\tan(y)|=\sin(x)+x+C</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Step 3:</em> I can't begin to solve this for <m>y</m>, 
                so I will just leave it with the implicit solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Step 4:</em> We divided by <m>\cos(y)</m> and <m>\cos(y)=0</m> 
                when <m>y=(2n+1)\pi/2</m> with
                <m>n</m> any integer. These are all solutions, as you should
                check and none of these are examples of the general solution so they are all
                singular solutions.

            </p>
            <p>
                First we find the general solution, then we will plug in the initial value
                to find the value of the constant.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Step 1</em> Separate the variables:

            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Step 2</em> Integrate both sides (remember you only need one constant of integration):

                    <mrow> \int \exp(y)\,dy \amp= \int \exp(x)\,dx </mrow>

            <p>
                <em>Step 3</em> Solve for the explicit solution (if possible and desired):

            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Step 4</em> Check for singular solutions:

            <p>
                Since this is an initial value problem, we don't need all solutions. If we
                can plug in the initial value and solve for the constant, we'll be done. If
                that doesn't work for some reason, then we can come back and look for a 
                singular solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that we have the general solution, we plug in our initial values, <m>x=0</m>
                and <m>y=2</m> and solve for the arbitrary constant.
                <md>

                </md>
                Plugging this in we get our solution to the initial value problem:
                <me>y = \ln(\exp(x) + \exp(2) - 1)</me>

            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Step 2</em> Integrate both sides (we will need to use partial fractions)

            <p>
                Plugging in <m>y(0)=-2</m>, we get

            <p>
                So plugging in the initial value led to an impossible equation. We said above
                we'd come back and look for a singular solution if things didn't work out. That
                is exactly where we are now.

            <p>
                Looking back over our work, we divided by <m>y^2+3y+2</m> in Step 1. That means
                we need to check what happens when <m>y^2+3y+2=0</m>, which happens when 
                <m>y=-1</m> or <m>y=-2</m>. Both of these are in fact solutions. If <m>y</m> takes
                the constant value -2, then our equation becomes
                <me>\frac{dy}{dx}=0=(-2)^2+3\times(-2)+1</me>. And since <m>y=-2</m> satisfies the 
                initial condition, our solution is
                <me>y = -2 </me>

            <title>
                Newton's Law of Cooling
            </title>
            <p>
                Newton's law of cooling says that the rate of change of the temperature of an
                object is proportional to the difference in temperature between the object and
                its environment.  Suppose that Andy prefers hot tea between the temperatures of
                90<degree/>C and 60<degree/>C. He gets his tea at 90<degree/>C, 
                but after 5 minutes it has cooled to 80<degree/>C. If the room temperature is 
                20<degree/>C, how much longer will Andy be able to enjoy his tea?
            </p>
            <p>
                We translate the problem to a differential equation, solve the equation, plug 
                in the the given values to find the constants, and then use the solution to 
                answer the question.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Step 0</em> Turn the problem statement into a mathematical statement:
            </p>
            <p>
                We let <m>T</m> be temperature in <degree/>C and <m>t</m> be time in minutes. Then
                Newton's law of cooling says <m>\frac{dT}{dt}=-r(T-20)</m>, since the room temperature
                is 20<degree/>C. Here <m>r</m> is the constant of proportionality in Newton's law, 
                and we write <m>-r</m> since the temperature is decreasing.
                We also have given values <m>T(0)=90</m> and <m>T(5)=80</m>. So to 
                find the formula for temperature of the tea, we need to solve
                <md>

                </md>
                It may look a bit odd to have two given values for a first-order equation, but 
                we have two constants we will need to find, both the constant of integration arising
                from the first-order equation and also the constant of proportionality from Newton's law.

                <md>
                    <mrow> \int\frac{dT}{T-20}\amp=\int -r\,dt </mrow>
                    <mrow> \ln\lvert T - 20 \rvert \amp= -rt+C</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Step 3</em> Solve for the explicit solution:
                <me>T = 20+ke^{-rt}</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we plug in our given values to find <m>k</m> and <m>r</m> From <m>T(0)=90</m> 
                we get <m>90 = 20 + k</m> so <m>k=70</m>. Then we plug in <m>T(5)=80</m> 
                and solve for <m>r</m>.
                <md>
                    <mrow>80 \amp=20 + 70e^{-5r} </mrow>
                    <mrow>6/7 \amp= e^{-5r}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\ln(6/7) \amp= -5r</mrow>
                    <mrow>-\frac{\ln(6/7)}{5} \amp=r</mrow>
                </md>
                So <m>r\approx0.03</m>, and our formula for temperature becomes
                <me>T(t) \approx 20 + 70e^{-0.03t}</me>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, to answer the question posed, we want to know when the temperature of the tea
                will reach 60<degree/>C.
                <md>
                    <mrow>60 \amp\approx 20 + 70e^{-0.03t} </mrow>
                    <mrow>\ln(4/7)\amp\approx -0.03t</mrow>
                    <mrow>18\amp\approx t</mrow>
                </md>
                Since 5 minutes has already passed, Andy only has about 13 minutes left to enjoy his
                tea.

            <p>
                A randomly generated example is given below. After you enter an answer, 
                you can click to see a detailed solution and also ask it to generate another example.
                You can use this to check your understanding, but you can also just enter a trivially
                wrong answer if you want (I usually use <m>y=x</m>) to quickly get to the detailed
                solution if that is what you want. So you can generate as many additional 
                examples as you want.
