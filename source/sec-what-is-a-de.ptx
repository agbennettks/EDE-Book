  <title>What is a differential equation</title>

  <introduction> 
    <p>A <em>differential equation</em> is an equation involving derivatives. </p>

    <title>Examples</title>
    <p>
      <me>\frac{dy}{dx}=2x^2 + 3y</me>
      <me>\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 2x\frac{dy}{dx} + \sin(x)y = e^x + \tan(x)</me>
      <me>\sin\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right) + y^2 = x</me>
    </p>
    <p>In the first example, <m>y</m> is to be a function of <m>x</m> whose derivative is 
      <m>2x^2</m> plus 3 times the original function <m>y</m>. Note that we write <m>y</m> 
      instead of <m>y(x)</m>. We will usually not distinguish between functions and variables 
      in our notation. It will actually make things easier in many problems to just think of 
      functions as variables and treat them accordingly. We will use both the notations
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> and <m>y'(x)</m> to express the derivative of <m>y</m> with 
      respect to <m>x</m>, though we will often abbreviate <m>y'(x)</m> as just <m>y'</m>, 
      just as we write <m>y</m> instead of <m>y(x)</m>. The <em>order</em> or a 
      differential equation is the highest order of derivative that occurs in the equation.
      The first and third examples are first order while the second example is second order.
      In this first chapter, we will consider first order equations. Selected equations of 
      higher order will be considered in subsequent chapters.

    <title>Interpretation of a Differential Equation</title>
    <p> Consider the first order equation <m>y' + y = x</m> We can interpret this both
      algebraically and geometrically. Algebraically, it means we are looking for a function,
      <m>y(x)</m>, for which the sum of its derivative and itself is equal to <m>x</m>.
      To give the geometric interpretation, it is helpful to write the equation in the 
      equivalent form, <m>y' = x - y</m>. Recall that the derivative is the slope of the
      tangent line to a curve. So we are looking for a curve whose slope at the point
      <m>(x,y)</m> is <m>x-y</m>. It is easiest to understandd what this geometri condition
      means using a type of graph called a <em>slope field</em>. We think of a small arrow 
      at each point <m>(x,y)</m> with slope <m>x-y</m>. Of course, to actually draw the 
      figure we will only use finitely many arrows. 
    </p>

    <p>A slope field is similar to a vector field, which you probably studied in 
        Calculus 3, except that in a vector field we plot vectors, which have both a length
        and a direction, while in a slope field we are just concerned with slope, that is
        direction, and not length
